# Enterprise LLM Ops: From Scratch to Scale

Welcome to the **Enterprise LLM Ops** project!

This repository is designed as a hands-on learning journey where we will explore how to take a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) and adapt it for specific enterprise purposes.

## Our Goal

To understand the lifecycle of LLM operations, specifically:

1.  **Environment Setup**: Building a robust Python environment for AI.
2.  **Model Adaptation**: Learning how to "make a model big" (i.e., highly capable for specific tasks) without the massive cost of pre-training from scratch.
3.  **Fine-Tuning**: Using techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning).
4.  **Deployment & Evaluation**: Testing our model to ensure it meets enterprise standards.

## The Approach

We are building this project slowly, phase by phase, to ensure a deep understanding of every file and configuration.

### Current Phase: Initialization

We are setting up the project structure and documentation.

## Next Steps

Check the `docs/` folder for our detailed learning plan.
